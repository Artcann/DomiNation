Create the model with the help of Guice's Dependency Injection and JavaFX's Properties, that way we can do data binding
which will facilitate the communication between the different Class of our Model. The main class of the Model will be
the GameEngine, and ideally the ViewModel will only deal with this Singleton class.

We don't have a lot of data to manage, I don't think we will need to use Scopes, our classes are already decoupled.

We have to create a visual example of the UI we want. We can do that before or after the Model, doesn't matter that much
but we need to do it BEFORE the ViewModel. We will have to do a lot of refactoring anyway I think so we can just start
with anything we want.
